# Pet Feeder Svelte

**!! This project is in development !!**
This is a rewrite of my [Pet Feeder](https://github.com/tayfunceylan/pet-feeder) project with all my current knowledge and using Svelte. I found Svelte to be a very interesting framework for its simplicity and wanted to try it out. Let's see how it goes.

## The Stack

- Svelte (Frontend)
- Shadcn Svelte (UI Library)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- Django (Backend)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Redis (Cache)

## New Goals

- This time this App should be designed in a way that other people can be invited to use it too
- Use Svelte for the frontend
- Use Shadcn Svelte and Tailwind CSS

## Development

Run `docker-compose up` to start the development server.
Then open `http://localhost` in your browser to see the app.
